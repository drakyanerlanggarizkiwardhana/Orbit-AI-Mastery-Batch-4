Data Science is a practice that combines knowledge and skills in statistics, mathematics, and programming to explore, analyze, and understand data in depth. In practice, Data Science involves a series of processes starting from data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, data modeling, and data interpretation. At each stage of the process, Data Scientist uses various techniques and algorithms to process data and generate insights that are relevant and actionable.

In the ever-evolving digital era, Data Science is increasingly important because the amount of data generated continues to increase. Using Data Science enables organizations to optimize their business, improve operational performance, and make better and more effective decisions.

Data Scientists must have extensive knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and programming, as well as have relevant domain knowledge. These skills enable them to work with data in areas such as business, marketing, health and social sciences to generate useful insights from existing data.
